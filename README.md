# Full Stack Home Credit Default Risk Prediction

In this project I have deployed a prediction model to the cloud (Heroku) by using Flask on backend and VueJS on frontend.

Thanks to Ayşe Teğen, Semih Uslu, Simge Ilgım Horat and Züleyha Koç. This is a team-work. Home crefit default risk dataset consists of several data table in csv format.

In the workload, I took the responsibility of studying the previous-applications data table and converting the final ensemble model (LightGBM + CatBoost) into a full stack web application.

The content will be uploaded soon.

Meanwhile you can visit and test the app on this address.
